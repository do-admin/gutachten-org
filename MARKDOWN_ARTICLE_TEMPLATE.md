# Your Article Title Here

Your opening paragraph should introduce the topic and provide context. Write this as continuous text without breaking it into multiple lines. Use **bold text** for emphasis on key terms and concepts.

## First Major Section

Content for your first major section goes here. Each paragraph should be written as a single continuous line of text. Don't break paragraphs unnecessarily across multiple lines.

### Subsection Title

More detailed content can go in subsections. Remember to maintain proper spacing - one blank line before and after headings.

## Second Major Section

You can include special content boxes like this:

> [!TIP]
>
> This is a helpful tip or important information. You can include **bold text** and [links](https://example.com) within these boxes.

Or use other box types:

> [!SUMMARY]
>
> Summary information or overview content goes here.

> [!FACT]
>
> Compact knowledge snippets or quick facts.

## Highlight Box with Image and CTA

For promotional content with images and call-to-action buttons:

> [!HIGHLIGHT_BOX_WITH_IMAGE_AND_CTA]
> title: Your Service Title
> description: A compelling description of your service or offer. Can include **bold text** and [links](https://example.com).
> features:

> - First key benefit or feature
> - Second key benefit or feature
> - Third key benefit or feature
>   cta: Call to Action Text
>   ctaUrl: /your-page-path
>   image: /images/gutachten-org/highlight-boxes/your-image.webp

## Tables

You can include tables using markdown syntax:

| Column 1 Header | Column 2 Header | Column 3 Header |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Row 1 Data      | Row 1 Data      | Row 1 Data      |
| Row 2 Data      | Row 2 Data      | Row 2 Data      |

## Lists

You can create lists like this:

- First item with **bold text**
- Second item with [a link](https://example.com)
- Third item

## Videos

To embed videos, use iframe tags (this is the ONLY HTML allowed):

<iframe title="Video Title" width="500" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

## Flowcharts

For step-by-step processes:

** [!SUMMARY] **

**1. First Step Description**

**↓**

**2. Second Step Description**

**↓**

**3. Third Step Description**

**BEISPIEL**

Example content explaining the process.

## Conclusion

Your concluding paragraph should summarize the main points and provide a clear takeaway for readers.

## Quellen (Sources)

If you have sources, list them like this:

- [Source Name](https://example.com)
- [Another Source](https://example.com)
